        <p>
            Welcome to our 3D Camera Calibration demo! This project provides insights into how multiple cameras perceive the same 3D space for applications in computer vision and robotics.
        </p>
        <p>
            We start with <strong>intrinsic camera calibration</strong> to identify each camera's internal characteristics, such as focal length and distortion, using calibration patterns from various angles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, we proceed to <strong>extrinsic camera calibration</strong>, determining the spatial relationships between the cameras to create a cohesive 3D representation of the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our interactive tool allows you to select a point in the field, instantly visualizing it across all camera views, showcasing the differences in perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, we offer <strong>3D ball tracking</strong>, which detects and tracks a moving ball across multiple camera views, providing real-time tracking useful for sports analysis and robotic navigation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Discover how our project enhances your understanding of spatial data!
